# Abyssal Voidling

Aiming to make this an "Accursed" version of Voidling. Right now HP and missile tracking is lowered to be more reasonable, move speed and attack speed are increased, spinbeam and vacuum attacks are faster as well. Each of these increase with each phase so there's some difficulty progression and it doesn't feel as lame. 

Phase info:

- Phase 1 Lorem Ipsum.
- Phase 2 Lorem Ipsum Electric Bugaloo.
- Phase 3 Lorem Ipsum the squeakquel.

## Plans

- Full configurability
- Adding a gimmick/ability for each phase so there's a larger difference between phases
- Adding a deterrent for just sitting on top the mf
- Adding some stuff to make it more fun

## Changelog
**0.5.0**

- Decreases HP and Missile tracking
- All stats increase with each phase
- Faster spinbeam and vacuum
