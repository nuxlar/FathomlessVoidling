# Fathomless Voidling

A Work In Progress of a Voidling rework mod, releasing it early with the intent on getting feedback/bugs before a 1.0 release. Report bugs in the github's issues tab and reach out on Discord (in either the Official RoR2 Discord / the Modding Discord) with any feedback. Currently only Phase 1 is reworked but the stats of the other phases have been reduced to Mithrix's level so you can continue the whole "fight". Stats are currently Mithrix level so Voidling is an actual alt final boss and not a DPS check, will have stat configs on full release.

Phase info:

- Phase 1 Buffed Reaver (Death Bubbles).
- Phase 2 Buffed Devastator (Mines?), Upgraded/Deadlier abilities.
- Phase 3 Buffed Jailer (Oughehe), Upgraded/Deadlier abilities.

Ability info (P1):

- Primary: Disillusion
  - Fires waves of void missiles and summons tracking death bombs
- Secondary: Crush
  - Launches a barrage of void meteors
- Utility: Transpose
  - Slips deeper into the void, reappears near the target
- Special: Desolate 
  - Launches an inaccurate barrage of lasers that rend whatever they touch
